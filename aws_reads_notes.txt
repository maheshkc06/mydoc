Amazon Notes:
=============
https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/case-studies/all
==
data center model:
	amazon perdix

Security Methods and Connectivity:
=
 security group
 VPC
 DirectConnect - availablityzone <-> datacenters, you can put your components in some DC
 Import/Export - Getting data from amazon after you disconnected the service from amazon
 VPN access - ( incase of hybrid clouds) on prem dc to amazon cloud
 Dedicated Server -

==
IAM - Identity Access Managment:-
	- user and service management
	- Control access to AWS resources
	- Multi-factor authentication
	- API access ( keys )
=
=
Ephemeral
 - Instance store
 - temp. block level storage
 - Free storage with EC2 instance
 - Data is lost when instance is terminated/stopped
 - Ideal for buffer,caches,scratch data....

S3:
 - First AWS service introduced in 2006
 - Internet accessible storage via http/https
 - Unlimited bucket size
 - Priced on storage used and transfer out
 - Its not a file-system 
 - 99.99% SLA ( uptime ) 
    Types:
   - Standard Storage - High resoultion photos
     - 99.9999999% durablity ( replicated data to different availablity zone )
   - RRS ( Reduced Redundancy Storage) ex: low resoultion photos
     - Reduced durablity ( 99.99%)
     - Price is cheap
 - Granular Storage type selection
 - Flat file structure
 - S3 bucket Name should be unique

EBS :
 - Not Internet accessible
 - Persistent file system to EC2
 - Does not need to be attached to an Instance ( flexbility to attach different instance)
 - Can be transferred between AZ
 - Support Incremental snapshots
 - EBL leverage use S3 to store snapshot
 - Provisioned IOPS ( level of performance)
 - Make sure EBS are created in AZ where the instance will be running
