Amazon Notes:
=============
https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/case-studies/all
==
data center model:
	amazon perdix

Security Methods and Connectivity:
=
 security group
 VPC
 DirectConnect - availablityzone <-> datacenters, you can put your components in some DC
 Import/Export - Getting data from amazon after you disconnected the service from amazon
 VPN access - ( incase of hybrid clouds) on prem dc to amazon cloud
 Dedicated Server -

==
IAM - Identity Access Managment:-
	- user and service management
	- Control access to AWS resources
	- Multi-factor authentication
	- API access ( keys )
=
=
Ephemeral
 - Instance store
 - temp. block level storage
 - Free storage with EC2 instance
 - Data is lost when instance is terminated/stopped
 - Ideal for buffer,caches,scratch data....

S3:
 - First AWS service introduced in 2006
 - Internet accessible storage via http/https
 - Unlimited bucket size
 - Priced on storage used and transfer out
 - Its not a file-system 
 - 99.99% SLA ( uptime ) 
    Types:
   - Standard Storage - High resoultion photos
     - 99.9999999% durablity ( replicated data to different availablity zone )
   - RRS ( Reduced Redundancy Storage) ex: low resoultion photos
     - Reduced durablity ( 99.99%)
     - Price is cheap
 - Granular Storage type selection
 - Flat file structure
 - S3 bucket Name should be unique

EBS :
 - Not Internet accessible
 - Persistent file system to EC2
 - Does not need to be attached to an Instance ( flexbility to attach different instance)
 - Can be transferred between AZ
 - Support Incremental snapshots
 - EBL leverage use S3 to store snapshot
 - Provisioned IOPS ( level of performance)
 - Make sure EBS are created in AZ where the instance will be running

Glacier :
 - Very very cheap storage
 - Used for infrequently used data, idea for backup
 - very very slow retrieval times ( 4 -6 hours)
 - High durablity
 - Cost for restore
 - AES 256 bit data encryption
 - after creating vault, user account needs to be added to access glacier.
 - secret access key has to be downloaded at the time account creation
 - ARN ( amazon resource name)

EC2: elastic compute cloud
 - Pay per user,scalable platform for VM's
 - AMI refers virtual disk template ( ex OVA,OVF)
 - import/export your own AMI ( cant' do the amazon created ami )

	AWS Terminology:

	ECU: ( ec2 compute unix - amazon moved away this concept) ( ECU -vCPU calculation )
	 - a relative measure of processing power
	 - abstract cpu hardware change
	 - One ECU is equivalent
	 - consistent amount of CPU capacity regardless of hardware
	 - Each instance type may be based on different physical processor

	EC2 Instance types 
		- Micro
		- General Purpose
		- Compute optimized
		- GPU instance
		- Memory optimized
		- Storage optimized
		- cdn.awsnow.info

EC2 Pricing: /ec2/pricing
 - Ondemand
	- Default type
	- Most expnsive option
	- Prices vary by aws region
	- Billed on hourly basis
 - Reserved Instance
	- Less expension
	- Requires commitment ( 1 or 3 years )
	- Has an upfront cost, lower hourly rate
	- RI can be sold on the aws market place
	- You commit to utilization
		- Light/Medium/Heavy utilization RIs
 - SPOT instance
	- comes from unused aws capacity
	- very cheap hourly rate
	- Not guaranteed
	- Based on a bid
	- Ideal for raw processing power,grid-like applications ( ideal use case for spot ?)
	- Higly scriptable
 - Misc Pricing
