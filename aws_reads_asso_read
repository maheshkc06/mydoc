VPC:
 - VPC regions wide
 - logically isolated network in the aws cloud
 - control of n/w architecture
 - Elastic IP address - public ip address
 - Enhance security
 - Enable hybrid cloud
 - single tenant dedicated server hardware
 
 VPC Elements:
 - Subnets
 - Route tables
 - Internet Gateway
 - Elastic Ips
 - Endpoints
 - NAT Gateway
 - Peering connection
 - Network ACLs
 - Securiy groups
 - VPN
 
 VPC Characteristics
 - aws reserves 5 ip addrsses per subnet ( first 4 and last 1)
 - private, public and vpn only 
 - do not span AZ
 - Single region,multi-AZ
 - CIDR 16 - 28
 - Select IP Prefix
 
NAT Instance/Gateway:

 - attached internet gateway to VPC
 - NAT Gateway:
  
 - Single nat gateway - bottlenecks
  - 
 - Use NAT gateway
  
 - To avoid bottlenecks
        
	- Increase instance size
        
	- choose instance that supports enhanced networking
        
	- Scale out - add NATS per subnet

 -Demo :NAT Instance vs NAT gateway

VPC:Endponts
 - Localize the traffic within VPC to access S3 service.
 - Demo: Endpoints Demo

VPC Connectivity:
 - VPC Peering
	- Single region inter-vpc
	- No overlapped CIDR nw
	- Same or different aws account
	- 50 VPC peers per VPC, upto 125 by request

AWS VPC access
VPN
 - hardware based
 - direct connect
 - VPN CLoudHub
 - software based
Gateway:

Direct connect -
 by default- direct connect did not come up with redundant
 direct connect can be partitiond as virtual interfaces

EC2 Instance types:
 -On demand
	- Based on capacity availablity
 -Reserved Instance - Guaranteed avaialablity
	- Standard - lower hourly rate, yearly commitment
	- Scheduled - Buy for partical time ( week, month, year)
 - SPOT instance -
  - Excessing capacity can be bid
  - immediatly loose access based on bid

-Dedicated Instance
  - Dedicated host - physcial host dedicated,bring your license scenario
  - Dedicated Instance - Loose visibility on which server you are running on. No licence can be used

=
Standard reserved instance attributes
 - All upfront - upto 68% over 3 yr term
 - Partial upfront - upto 60% over 3 yr term
 - No upfront - upto 30% over a 1 yr term

Scheduled reserved instance attributes:
 - One year commitment is required
 - charged hourly and billed at monthly

Modifying your RIs
 - Switch AZ within same region
 - change the instance size within the same instance type
 - Instance type modifications are supported only for Linux
 - Cannot change the instance size of windows instance

Instance Normalalization factor:

High Performance Computing:

Placement group:
 - a logical grouping of instance in a single AZ
 - Cant span multiple AZ
 - Achieve low latency requirements, high performance requirement
 - only supported enhanced networking
 - Existing instance cannot be moved into a placement group
 - Instance has to be deciced at creation time
 - placement group cannot be merged
 - can span peered vpc but there are limitations
 
 Load balancer
 - Classic load balancer
	- Region wide load balancer
	- can be used internally or externally ( internet facing)
 	- Layer 4 and Layer 7
	- SSL termination and Processing ( off loading instance of processes)
	- Cookie-based sticky session
	- Integrates with auto scaling
	- ELB give ec2 health checks / cloudwatch
	- Integrates with Route 53
	- Supported Ports - 25, 80,443,1024-65535
	- Does not support EIP (public IP), route 53 sits in front
	- Support ipv4/v6
	- integrates with cloud trail
	- Multiple ssl certificates require multiple elbs
	- wildcards certificates are supported
	- Its a platform service
	- Create load balancer from EC2 link in console

- Application Load balancer
	- Layer 7 only
	- Content based routing
	- Support microservices and containers
	- Integrates with elastic container servers
	- better performance for real time streaming
	- Reduced hourly cost
	- Deletion protection
	- Better health checks
	- Path based routing

Instance storage types:
 - Instance store : Ephermal storage
	- Used for temporary storage
	- Local storage for particular instance

 - EBS : Elastic block storage [ https://aws.amazon.com/ebs/details/ ]
	- GP-SSD 
	- PIOPS - Provisioned IOPS ()
	- Throughput Optimized HDD
	- Cold HDD - use cases big-data
	- Magnectic
		* Difference based on iops and thoughput it generates
	
	Characteristics:
	- Does not need to be attached to an instance
	- Cannot be attached to more than one at same time
	- Can be trnasferred between AZ
	- EBS volume data is replicated across multiple servers in an AZ 
	- Encryption of EBS data volumes, boot volumes and snapshots
	- AFR ( annual failure rate ) 0.1% to 0.2% , SLA 99.95%
	- 
	
Increase IOPS Performance:
	- RAID 0 using stripped gp2 or standard volumes, or striped PIOPS volumes

In Demo:
	- Option 'auto-enable IO' - if any inconsistency with volume, it will be disable IO traffic		
	- iops/size is 50:1 ( ex 15000/50=300)

EBS-Optimized Instance:
	- Dedicated capacity for amazon EBS I/O
	- Designed for use with all ebs volume types
	- max bandwidth 400Mbps - 12,000Mbps
	- IOPS: 3000 -65000
	
EBS snapshot characteristics:
	- Point in time snapshots
	- Supports incremental snapshots
	- Billed only for the changed blocks
	- Deleting a snapshot removes oly the data not needed by any other snapshot
	- Leverage S3 to store snapshots

EBS snapshot Features
	- Resizing EBS volumes
	- Sharing EBS snapshots
	- Copying EBS snapshots across regions
	- Flow for increasing the size of volume from snapshot:Powerdown/detach/snapshot/increasesize/powerup


EFS - Elastic File System
 	- Network attached Storage as a service
	- Simple, petabytes scalable file storage for use with EC2 instance
	- EFS file systems are elastic, automatically grow and shrink as you add and remove files
	- Stored redundanty across multiple AZs
	- 1 to 1000 EC2 instance, from multiple AZA, concurrently
	- use cases home directories ,bigdata analytics ..
	- By default, 10 file systems per aws account per regions
	- Supports NFS 4.1
	- On-premises access enabled via direct connect
