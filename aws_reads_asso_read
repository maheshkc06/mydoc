VPC:
 - VPC regions wide
 - logically isolated network in the aws cloud
 - control of n/w architecture
 - Elastic IP address - public ip address
 - Enhance security
 - Enable hybrid cloud
 - single tenant dedicated server hardware
 
 VPC Elements:
 - Subnets
 - Route tables
 - Internet Gateway
 - Elastic Ips
 - Endpoints
 - NAT Gateway
 - Peering connection
 - Network ACLs
 - Securiy groups
 - VPN
 
 VPC Characteristics
 - aws reserves 5 ip addrsses per subnet ( first 4 and last 1)
 - private, public and vpn only 
 - do not span AZ
 - Single region,multi-AZ
 - CIDR 16 - 28
 - Select IP Prefix
 
NAT Instance/Gateway:

 - attached internet gateway to VPC
 - NAT Gateway:
  
 - Single nat gateway - bottlenecks
  - 
 - Use NAT gateway
  
 - To avoid bottlenecks
        
	- Increase instance size
        
	- choose instance that supports enhanced networking
        
	- Scale out - add NATS per subnet

VPC:Endponts
 - Localize the traffic within VPC to access S3 service.
 - Demo: Endpoints Demo

VPC Connectivity:
 - VPC Peering
	- Single region inter-vpc
	- No overlapped CIDR nw
	- Same or different aws account
	- 50 VPC peers per VPC, upto 125 by request

AWS VPC access
VPN
 - hardware based
 - direct connect
 - VPN CLoudHub
 - software based
Gateway:

Direct connect -
 by default- direct connect did not come up with redundant
 direct connect can be partitiond as virtual interfaces

EC2 Instance types:
 -On demand
	- Based on capacity availablity
 -Reserved Instance - Guaranteed avaialablity
	- Standard - lower hourly rate, yearly commitment
	- Scheduled - Buy for partical time ( week, month, year)
 - SPOT instance -
  - Excessing capacity can be bid
  - immediatly loose access based on bid

-Dedicated Instance
  - Dedicated host - physcial host dedicated,bring your license scenario
  - Dedicated Instance - Loose visibility on which server you are running on. No licence can be used

=
Standard reserved instance attributes
 - All upfront - upto 68% over 3 yr term
 - Partial upfront - upto 60% over 3 yr term
 - No upfront - upto 30% over a 1 yr term

Scheduled reserved instance attributes:
 - One year commitment is required
 - charged hourly and billed at monthly

Modifying your RIs
 - Switch AZ within same region
 - change the instance size within the same instance type
 - Instance type modifications are supported only for Linux
 - Cannot change the instance size of windows instance

Instance Normalalization factor:

High Performance Computing:

Placement group:
 - a logical grouping of instance in a single AZ
 - Cant span multiple AZ
 - Achieve low latency requirements, high performance requirement
 - only supported enhanced networking
 - Existing instance cannot be moved into a placement group
 - Instance has to be deciced at creation time
 - placement group cannot be merged
 - can span peered vpc but there are limitations
