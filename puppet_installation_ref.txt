=========

Environments root dir: /etc/puppet/environments
Puppet conf file is : /etc/puppet/puppet.conf
{contain there section Main,Master and Agent }

==========
Setting up production environment ( example from pluralsight)

# cd /etc/puppet/environments/
# mkdir -p production/{modules,manifests}

# cd production
# cat > environment.conf
modulepath = /etc/puppet/environments/production/modules
environment_timeout = 5s
^D to save
Next edit master config file to refer this env.
#vi /etc/puppet/puppet.conf and update below line in [main] section
    dns_alt_names = puppet,puppetmaster,puppetmaster.chimah.com

and add below section
[master]
    environmentpath = $confdir/environments/
    basemodulepath = $confdir/modules:/opt/puppet/share/modules

====
=> set SELinux to permissive mode
#sudo setenforce permissive
#vi /etc/sysconfig/selinux -> replace enforcing with 'permissive'
[root@puppetmaster puppet]# getenforce
Enforcing
[root@puppetmaster puppet]# setenforce permissive
[root@puppetmaster puppet]# getenforce
Permissive

=>Generating SSL certificates:
#puppet master --verbose --no-daemonize

First time, It will look for any ssl certificate specified in $ssldir, if not then it will create one.
#ls /var/lib/puppet/ssl/

[to regenerate ssl file, these files can be removed and run puppet run again]

=>Adjust Iptables
file:/etc/sysconfig/iptables
add this rule
-A INPUT -m state --state NEW -m tcp -p tcp --dport 8140 -j ACCEPT
